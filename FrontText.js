            <p>This is a website. Are you an idiot? You must be. You seem like a real clown, that's all. Why else would you be on this website. Anyway, give me money.</p>
            <p>I should be serious, shouldn't I? Too bad I'm physically incapable of doing that. I dedicate this website to Jenna. She's a real icon, Jenna is. She's just, very good, that's all. Jenna's sitting next to me helping me develop this website. It's really cool, isn't it? She's just hanging out and that's real rad. I just have no idea what to put on this section of the website.</p>
            <p>I need to do something else with this, I really really do. I wanna do some good stuff. I wanna make other pages. I think I will! Try clicking those buttons above and see which one will take you to a different page. If you find the one that lets you give me money, you have to give me money.</p>
            <p>Right now I'm watching Ouran High School Host Club and it's dope as hell. This show is so very incredible. Very fun</p>
            <p>Anyway, this is buffzeed.com, my masterpiece. Explore, have fun, give me money please. I love you. </p>
